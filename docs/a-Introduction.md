# Rippling's API Platform

The Rippling API Platform enables the access and processing of company and employee information through web services.

The API will continue to evolve as more endpoints and capabilities are added. If there are specific endpoints or features that you would benefit from, please email apps@rippling.com.

Please note, it is in violation of Rippling's Terms of Service to use a an API key in order to access the Rippling development platform, if that API key does not belong to your organization.

## Partners

Rippling requires that all application partners build integrations within [Rippling's App Shop](rippling.com/app-shop). The Rippling App Shop provides a opportunity to showcase your application to Rippling's clients, as well as securely and transparently acquire the proper permissions to access customer information. 

If you are interested in building an application with Rippling, please see the [Partners Guide](https://rippling.stoplight.io/docs/rippling-api/docs/b-Partners.md) on building with Rippling.
