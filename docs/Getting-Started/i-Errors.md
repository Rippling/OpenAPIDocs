| 403            | Forbidden: You do not have permission to perform this action. The user possibly does not have sufficient permissions to access the requested endpoint. If you run into this when first installing the app, you should not mark it as a successful installation. If this shows after the connection was established, it might be that the user who installed your App at Rippling has lost the appropriate admin permissions. For example, if a user for your Rippling account, but not a Payroll admin, installs a payroll app on Rippling, the data flow would result in the user gaining access to restricted data. | You will want to alert the user that the connection has been disrupted. You should then request another admin to go through the installation flow by hitting the installation url. If the same user tries to install the App, you will still end up with a 403. You should request the user contacts another admin with more permissions to install the app. |
