# Customers

Rippling customers access the Rippling API to retrieve and update information on their organization's behalf.

If you are a Rippling customer, you will need to create an API key with defined scopes in order to access the Rippling API.

Note, the API key will only be able to access data that you specifically enable it to during the API Key creation process. You will need to explicitly grant the API key access to data fields on behalf of your organization.

1. [Log in to Rippling as an admin for your organization](https://app.rippling.com/login)
