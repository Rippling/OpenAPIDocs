# Rippling's API Platform

> Please note that we are currently in the process of transitioning to a new Sandbox environment. As part of this change, Rippling will be deprecating stage.rippling.com which will take place on **May 7th, 2021**. Please make sure that you've made all the appropriate changes on your side in advance of this change.

The Rippling API Platform enables partners and customers to access Rippling company and employee information when granted the appropriate permissions.

The API will continue to evolve as more endpoints and capabilities are added. If there are specific endpoints or features that you would benefit from, please submit a [Developer Feedback Survey](https://developer.rippling.com/docs/rippling-api/docs/Submit/feedback-survey.md).

Please note, it is in violation of Rippling's Terms of Service to use an API key on behalf of another organization in order to access the Rippling API Platform. All Rippling partners must use OAuth to integrate with Rippling's API, as detailed in our [authorization guide](https://developer.rippling.com/docs/rippling-api/docs/Getting-Started/f-Authorization.md).

## Customers

Rippling customers use their API keys in order to access the Rippling API Platform.

If you're a Rippling customer, please see the [Customer Guide](https://developer.rippling.com/docs/rippling-api/docs/Getting-Started/b-Customers.md) on building with Rippling.

## Partners

Rippling requires that all application partners build integrations within [Rippling's App Shop](https://rippling.com/app-shop). The Rippling App Shop provides a opportunity to showcase your application to Rippling's clients, as well as securely and transparently acquire the proper permissions to access customer information. 

If you are interested in building an application with Rippling, please see the [Partner Guide](https://developer.rippling.com/docs/rippling-api/docs/Getting-Started/c-Partners.md). Note, Rippling partners are required to use OAuth in order to integrate with Rippling and to your integration in the App Shop.

You will be required to submit a [Rippling Development Package](https://developer.rippling.com/docs/rippling-api/docs/Submit/development-package.md) in order to configure your integration and provide your marketing assets.

### The Rippling App Shop

The Rippling App Shop showcases Rippling partners' integrated applications. From the App Shop, Rippling customers install third-party integrations and identify providers within various service segments, such as Collaboration or Office Management. Rippling partners have the opportunity to leverage the co-marketing opportunity to reach new customers.

The Rippling App Shop is used by a wide span of roles, ranging from HR & IT directors, to founders, to employees.
