In return, you will receieve your Rippling App Testing Package. The Rippling App Testing Package consists of the following information.

- Staging Client ID
- Staging Client Secret
- Application Name
- Staging Account Credentials for testing

Once you have built and tested the integration, the Rippling team may ask for a demo (either live or as a video) of your integration before approval. Once your integration has been approved, Rippling will provide you with the Rippling App Production Package.

- Production Client ID
- Production Client Secret
- Application Name
- Test Account Credentials for testing the application in production

To launch the application, the Rippling team will ask for live or recorded demo of your application in order to approve the application in the Rippling App Shop. Once the team has approved the integration, the application will be made live in the Rippling App Shop.
