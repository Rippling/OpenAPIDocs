# Partner Applications

To get started with building an application on Rippling you will need to submit a development package to application.partnerships@rippling.com.

The development package consists of the following assets:

- Application Listing Assets
- Configuration Properties

## Application Listing Assets

### Application Overview

A brief overview of your company's application. Please limit this overview to 180 characters. Please note, this can be changed later on, but will be required to register your application.

### Product Description

An in-depth description of your company's application and its product features. Please note, this can be changed later on, but will be required to register your application.

### Integration Description

An in-depth description of how your application will integrate with Rippling. Please note, this can be changed later on, but will be required to register your application.

### Logo Package

A montone logo badge to accompany your application listing. While we understand the needs of a logo vary on a case by case basis, we generally ask that you provide the following assets as your logo package to ensure the highest quality listing.

- An SVG file of your logo, highly preferred to be in a monotone representation of your logo.
- A HEX color that will be used as the background of your SVG logo.
