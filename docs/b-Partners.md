- employee
- employee:workEmail
- employee:title

For more information on Rippling scopes, please see [here](https://rippling.stoplight.io/docs/rippling-api/docs/e-Scopes.md).

### Build the Integration

Once your development package has been reviewed, you will receieve your Rippling App Testing Package to test and build the integration. The Rippling App Testing Package consists of the following information.

- Staging Client ID
- Staging Client Secret
- Application Name
- Staging Account Credentials for testing

Please note, if your integration requires access to Webhooks, you will build the integration against Rippling's Production Environment. If this is required, please mention this in the submission of your Devlopment Package.

### Receive Approval from Rippling

Once you have built and tested the integration, the Rippling team may ask for a demo (either live or as a video) of your integration before approval. Once your integration has been approved, Rippling will provide you with the Rippling App Production Package.

- Production Client ID
- Production Client Secret
- Application Name
- Test Account Credentials for testing the application in production

You will then release a production version of your integration that is ready for launch.

### Launch the Integration

To launch the application, the Rippling team will ask for live or recorded demo of your application in order to approve the listing to go live in the Rippling App Shop. Once the team has approved the integration, the application will be made publicly visible in [the Rippling App Shop](rippling.com/app-shop).
