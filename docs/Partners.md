# Partner Applications

To get started with building an application on Rippling, we will need several configuration properties for your application.

URL           | Description
--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redirect URLs | You have the option to provide two redirect URLs: Staging Redirect URL and Production Redirect URL.
SSO URLs      | You have the option to provide two SSO URLs: Staging SSO URL and Production SSO URL. These rely on Rippling's authentication tokens to allow users to sign-in.
Webhook URL  |  You have the option to provide one Webhook URL: Production Webhook URL. *Rippling does not support Webhooks on our staging environment.*

Additionally, you will need to provide Rippling with your application scopes. These scopes are transparently displayed to Rippling customer's that choose to install the application.
