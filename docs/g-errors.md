| 403            | Forbidden: ("You do not have permission to perform this action.") The user possibly does not have sufficient permissions to fetch the endpoint that you are trying to access. If we run into this the first time, you should not mark it as a successful response. If the connection was established and then this comes up. It might be that the user who installed your App at Rippling has lost their admin permissions. An example of this is that say we have a person X who is an app admin at Rippling, but not a Payroll admin, if the person goes through the installation flow and connects a payroll app to Rippling, the data flow might result in the person having access to some information that the admin would not want them to have. | You would want to show a box that the connection has been disrupted and request some other admin to go through the installation flow by hitting the installation url. (If the same user tries to install the App, you’d still end up with a 403, so it requests someone with more permissions to install the app) |
